<!-- $project-blurb = HP Papers knew that they needed something visually striking to grab visitorâ€™s attention and set HP Papers apart from other paper companies, while still keeping the website easy to navigate and within brand. After several rounds of exploration, we went with 3D paper boxes floating and rotating in space as a visitor scrolls down the page and an interactive paper selector. They were so happy with this solution, they came back again for us to design their global portal landing page. In this case we designed a 3D interactive region chooser. -->
